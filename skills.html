										<h2>Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Learning algorithms and data structures has been the key part of my journey in CS. I began with data types such as arrays and linked lists, and as I progressed in C, I advanced to working with maps, graphs, trees, and more complex structures. I've applied these concepts in labs, including solving a time-window constraint problem using map implementations and Dijkstra’s algorithm to optimize performance.</p>

												<h3>Software Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My interest in computer science started with a curiosity about how software and applications are built. Over time, this evolved into experience in front-end development. I am proficient in HTML and CSS and have additional experience building interactive interfaces using React. I enjoy creating something new and innovative.</p>

												<h3>AI & Data Analysis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As AI evolves, so has my interest in its role in data analysis. I have completed coursework in machine learning and gained experience working in Python, along with a solid understanding of the mathematical concepts that create these models. I'm particularly interested in how data-driven insights can be applied to real-world problems.</p>

												<h3>GIS</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I gained GIS experience during my internship at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). There, I worked with tools such as ArcGIS to visualize and analyze weeks of research data, helping transform master datasets into meaningful geographic insights.</p>

									<p>Cloud computing was an area I explored early in my journey through a micro-internship at Sketch Development Services. During this experience, I worked with AWS and got hands-on exposure to deploying and managing Docker containers, strengthening my understanding of scalable and modern cloud-based infrastructure.</p>
